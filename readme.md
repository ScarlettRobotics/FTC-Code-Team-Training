# Scarlett Robotics FTC Code Team Training
Welcome to Scarlett Robotics. This repo contains everything you need to learn to program an FTC robot.

## Training Overview
Before starting to code the robot, a basic understanding of Java is required. Here is an overview of the training schedule
* Learn Java [↵](docs/learning_java.md)
* Java OOP Assignment [↵](assignments/java_oop_assignment.md)
* Git Assignment [↵](docs/git/learning_git.md)
* Install Required Software [↵](docs/software_guide.md)
    * Please do this on your personal laptop. You should try to bring in your laptop since we are unable to do this on the desktops, and we do not have many loaner laptops. (If you do not have a laptop to bring in, that is fine, please come to talk to a code team lead.)
